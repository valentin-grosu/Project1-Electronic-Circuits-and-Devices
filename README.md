# Project1-Electronic-Circuits-and-Devices
This is a project developed at university. I designed a low frequency audio amplifier using BJTs. In the process of this design I used 4 stages for the circuit, entry stage, voltage gain stage, current gain stage and output stage. This circuit use a negative feedback loop which set the gain at about 10.
